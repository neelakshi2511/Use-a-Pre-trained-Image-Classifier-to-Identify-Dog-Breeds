Questions regarding Uploaded Image Classification:

1. Did the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: YES


2. Did each of the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: YES


3. Did the three model architectures correctly classify Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg to not be dogs? If not, report the misclassifications.

Answer:NO:The three model architectures correctly classified Animal_Name_01.jpg as a dog and correctly classified Object_Name_01.jpg as not a dog.


4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

Answer:The ResNet and AlexNet model architectures demonstrated similar performance, yielding identical outputs when provided with equal time resources. In terms of efficiency, the most optimal model algorithm is the one that consumes fewer time resources while maintaining accuracy. On the other hand, the VGG model architecture required a longer runtime compared to the other models.
